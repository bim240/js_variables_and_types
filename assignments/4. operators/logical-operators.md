# Logical Operator

1. ðŸ¥‡What's the output of the following, write the output next to the code as comment.

* [ ] Logical AND operation

```js
true  && true;  true
true  && false; false
false && true;  false
false && false; false
"foo" && "bar"; bar
"bar" && "foo"; foo
"foo" && "";    ""
""    && "foo"; ""
" "   && "John" && "" && false  ""
false && "Hey" && undefined   false
"undefined" && false && 42      false
```

* [ ] Logical OR operation
```js
true  || true;  true
true  || false; true
false || true; true
false || false; false
"foo" || "bar"; foo
"bar" || "foo"; bar
"foo" || "";  foo
""    || "foo"; foo
" "   || "John" || "" || false  " "
false || "Hey" || undefined Hey
"undefined" || false || 42  "undefined"
```

2. ðŸ¥ˆYou have two variables i.e `isGuestOneVeg` and  `isGuestTwoVeg` according to the value using logical && and || opeartor do the following.

* [ ] If both are veg "Only offer up vegan dishes." 
* [ ] At least one veg  "Make sure to offer up some vegan options."   isGuestOneVeg` and  `isGuestTwoVeg`
* [ ] Else, "Offer up anything on the menu"
```js
let isGuestOneVeg = false;
let isGuestTwoVeg = false;
if (isGuestOneVeg && isGuestTwoVeg)
alert("Only offer up vegan dishes.");
else if (isGuestOneVeg || isGuestTwoVeg)
    alert( "Make sure to offer up some vegan options.");
else 
    alert( "Offer up anything on the menu")


3. ðŸŽ–Using the variable `temperature` and logical operators do the following
* [ ] If temperature is less then 32 alert "It is freezing outside"
* [ ] If the temperature is greater then 110 alert "It is hot outside"
* [ ] else 'Go for it. It is pretty nice out'

let temperature = 4;
if (temperature<32)
    alert("It is freezing outside");
else if (temperature>100)
    alert"It is hot outside");
else 
    alert('Go for it. It is pretty nice out');


4. ðŸŽ– Output of this and the reason behind the output.
```js
alert( alert(1) || 2 || alert(3) );
```
first we will see 1 , because as bracket starts it alert 1 but as alert doent return anything so undefined it moves forward. now 2 is next value so 2 is a truthy value so now it become alert(2)
so output is 2.
